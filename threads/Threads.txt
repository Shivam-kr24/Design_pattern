Threads in python are an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution. In simpler words, a thread is a computation process that is to be performed by a computer. It is a sequence of such instructions within a program that can be executed independently of other codes.

Points to remember while joining threads using join() in Python:

A run time error occurs when join() method is invoked on the same thread as calling join() on the same thread results in a deadlock condition.
If the join() method is called on a thread which is yet to be started , then a run time error is raised.
If the join() has the timeout argument then it should be a floating point number representing the time for the operation of thread in seconds.
If the join() method has no argument, the until the thread terminates the operation is blocked.
As the value returned by join() is always None, we should always use isAlive() immediately after join() to check whether the thread is still alive or not.
