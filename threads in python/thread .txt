Q.. what is thread ?
--individual and separate unit of execution that is part of a process.
--multiple threads can work together to accomplish a common goal.

---Threads allow the program to run tasks in parallel.
 we understand through an example of video Game
      --  in video Game ----
          - one thread for graphics
         -- one thread for user interaction.
         -- one thread for networking.
  there are two types of thread
  -- kernal thread
  ---user Thread

Advantages of Threading-----
-- Multithreaded programs can run faster on computer system with multiple cpu.
---A program can remain responsive to input this is true both on single and on multiple cpu.
-- Allows to do something else while one thread is waiting for an I/O task to complete.
-- Some programs are easy to express using concurrency.
-- threads of a process can share the memory of global variables.

------THREAD ISSUES--------
--scheduling
--resources sharing
--synchronization.


---------------xxxxx THREADS IN PYTHON XXX------------
 ---- In Python, a thread is a object
         -- holding data
         --run with methods
         --stored in data structure
         ---passed in parameters to method
     --- A thread can also be executed as a process
     -- During its lifetime , a thread can be in various states.

 -- In python , it supports two module .
  --- modules which support the usage of threads in python.
    --- thread
    ---- threading

  -- the thread module has been considered as "deprecated"
  -- renamed to "_thread" for backwards in compatibilities in python3 one thread for user interaction
-- The module "thread " treats a thread as a function , will be module "threading" is implemented in an object-oriented
      way.
